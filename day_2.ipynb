      "\n",
      "* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n",
      "* 1/4 cup granulated sugar\n",
      "* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened\n",
      "\n",
      "For the Peach Filling:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 2 cups fresh or frozen peaches, sliced\n",
      "* 1/4 cup granulated sugar\n",
      "* 2 tablespoons cornstarch\n",

      "Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).\n",
      "2. Prepare the shortbread crust: In a medium bowl, whisk together flour and sugar. Add softened butter and mix until the dough comes together. Press the dough into a 9x13-inch baking dish.\n",
      "3. Prepare the peach filling: In a large bowl, combine sliced peaches, granulated sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and salt. Mix well to coat the peaches evenly.\n",
      "4. Assemble the bars: Pour the peach mixture over the shortbread crust. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until the fruit is tender and the topping is golden brown.\n",
      "5. Prepare the bourbon vanilla ice cream: Scoop the vanilla ice cream into bowls and drizzle with bourbon whiskey, if using.\n",
      "6. Serve: Cut the cobbler bars into squares and serve warm with a scoop of bourbon vanilla ice cream.\n",

      "**Tips and Variations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* To add an extra layer of flavor, sprinkle some chopped pecans or walnuts on top of the shortbread crust before baking.\n",
      "* If you prefer a more intense peach flavor, use 3 cups of sliced peaches instead of 2.\n",
      "* For a grown-up twist, drizzle the cobbler bars with a caramel sauce made from heavy cream, butter, and sea salt.\n",
      "\n",
